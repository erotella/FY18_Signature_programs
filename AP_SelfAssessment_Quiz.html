	<p>The Aspiring Principals Standards define what Residents need to know and be able to do to lead schools in preparing all students to be successful in college, careers, and citizenship. The Resident Self-Assessment provides a formal opportunity to reflect on your knowledge and skills in relation to these standards.</p>
<br>
	<p><strong><u>Directions</u></strong></p>
	<p>Using the scale provided, please assess yourself against each of the specific competencies embedded within the five over-arching program standards. As you complete the ratings, imagine yourself in the role of Resident Principal, working with adults you do not know.</p>

	<p><strong><u>Technical Notes<u></strong></p>
	<p>Please plan to complete the Self-Assessment in one sitting. If you lose power or lose your internet connection while completing the assessment, you should be able to re-enter where you left off by clicking the reflection link again.</p>
	<p>Once you submit your Self-Assessment, you will be unable to access/edit your scores.</p>
