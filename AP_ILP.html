		The purpose of the Individual Learning Plan (ILP) is to identify a set of activities and experiences that you will engage in to focus your learning and skill building over the course of the Residency year. The areas you choose to focus on will be unique to your learning needs and Residency context. The ILP reflects the &ldquo;Practice&rdquo; and &ldquo;Feedback&rdquo; aspects of the Aspiring Principals Learning Cycle by detailing targeted opportunities for deep practice and learning. Your commitment to creating and completing the ILP, in addition to working to meet the other program expectations, will support your work in demonstrating proficiency against the Aspiring Principal Standards.

		After completing the <a href ="https://newleaders.instructure.com/courses/214/quizzes/2461" target="_blank">Aspiring Principals Program 2017-18 Resident Self-Assessment</a> in Canvas (either during or after Summer Foundation), you will develop your ILP so that it is finalized at one of your first coaching sessions. You and your Director will revisit and review your growth and progress during subsequent coaching sessions during the year. This ongoing review of the ILP and your growth allows for continued skill building over the course of your Residency year. You will have the opportunity to update/revise your ILP focus areas and targets at Learning Meeting #2 after you receive Mid-Year 360 survey data.

		Successful completion of the ILP provides evidence of your ability to reflect on your leadership practice, receive feedback and adjust your practice. The ILP is not a specific endorsement requirement. However, meeting or not meeting your ILP targets provides evidence of your ability to demonstrate proficiency and achieve the SMART goals you established in your strategic plan. You are required to complete an ILP in addition to the content and learning experiences that you receive during the Residency year, because the ILP outlines what is unique to your leadership training path in service of becoming proficient in in the Aspiring Principal Standards.
